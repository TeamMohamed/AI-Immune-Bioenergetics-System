# Quantum Immune Bioenergetics System

ðŸ§¬ A next-generation immune recalibration system integrating **AI**, **quantum bioenergetics**, **cytokine modulation**, and **frequency-coded healing protocols**.

This repository hosts the white paper, references, licensing, and supplementary materials for:
**"AI-Driven Quantum Immunology: The Future of Immune System Bioenergetics"**

## ðŸ§  About the System

This system introduces a clinically relevant, AI-enhanced framework designed to:

- ðŸ”‹ Rebuild immune cell bioenergetics via ATP tuning and mitochondrial optimization
- âš¡ Suppress cytokine storms using Hz-calibrated immune repolarization
- ðŸ§¬ Reprogram immune dysfunctions using miRNA, histone, and CRISPR overlays
- ðŸ§  Interface with ECS, vagus nerve, redox, and stem-cell immune triggers
- ðŸ§  Prevent or reverse immune aging, autoimmune collapse, chronic inflammation, and metabolic burnout

Backed by quantum field biology, epigenetic control systems, and over 100 proprietary datasets.

> **"This isn't immunomodulation. It's immune system redesign."**
